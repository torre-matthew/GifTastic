# Horror Movie Showdown

* I built this as fantasy football season was kicking off. With Halloween right around the corner, the idea is taking a fantasy horror movie lineup I created and having the user try to come up with a "scarier" lineup.

## Technologies used:
* Giphy API
* OMDB API
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
